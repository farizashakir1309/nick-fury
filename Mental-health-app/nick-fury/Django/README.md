### Assessment Criteria
1. Meeting ALL criteria (which are not explicitly marked as optional) in the [Instructions](#instructions)

4. Ownership - going beyond the exact job description to deliver a finished product. For a Django dev, this could translate to creating a sample API-driven UI that also communicates with this API
