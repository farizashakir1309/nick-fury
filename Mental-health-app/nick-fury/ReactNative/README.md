*Note: This is a public submission. Any work on this assignment does not bring Wealth42 or its employees any moat; and by design, is made to assess skills we need. Stories provided are unrelated to Wealth42's core business.* 

### Assignment
*   You can select any one of the stories mentioned in the [stories](../stories/) folder, and develop a React Native App for it. 
*   Follow [Instructions](#instructions) and [Submission Process](#submission-process) to complete the assignment.
*   For success, ensure you get as many checks as in our [Assessment Criteria](#assessment-criteria)
*   We typically take 5 days to evaluate this submission.

### Instructions
*   API: 
    *   Create stubs based on the user story selected
    *   Mock those stubs (an easy way to do this is to use Postman)
    *   Integrate with the mock stubs
*   View: 
    *   Design reusable components that are used across all the screens relevant
    *   Include any collateral/stock images (make sure these are okay for public use)
    *   Include icons/vector art wherever relevant
*   State Management: 
    *   Use redux for state management
    *   thunk/saga for middleware
*   Routing: Use React Navigation

### Assessment Criteria
1. Meeting ALL criteria (which are not explicitly marked as optional) in the [Instructions](#instructions)
2. Maintainability and organisation of code.
3. Usage of
    1. Redux for state management
    2. Saga/Thunk for middleware
    3. UI Component libraries
4. Balancing between speed and quality of code - we understand that candidates can only spend limited time on these challenges. If you do make any trade-offs in favour of saving time, do mention them in comments.
5. Ownership - going beyond the exact job description to deliver a finished product. For a React Native dev, this could translate to: 
    1. creating mocks from the API documentation
    2. adding icons/collateral 
6. No submissions to be made with compressed/binary files - all source code should be version controlled and visible in plain text in github.
7. How much the candidate stays in touch with us during the process of the project.
8. Follow [best practices](https://github.community/t/best-practices-for-pull-requests/10195) for pull requests.
9. [Guidelines](https://gist.github.com/turbo/efb8d57c145e00dc38907f9526b60f17) for clean commit messages.
10. Ability to learn and use version control via Git

### Submission Process
1. Fork this repository to your personal Github profile
2. Remove all files and folders in the forked repository and start developing your project in it
3. Add a readme to the root location of your repository that details on exactly how to run the code
4. Fill the [Pull Request template](https://github.com/wealth42/nick-fury/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md) while you are raising a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
    *   Check all the boxes that your Pull Request fulfills.
    *   Answer ALL questions in the template

### Code of Ethics
Please be original, all your submissions are public via GitHub.
Cite any external piece of code you're using, preferably with a link to the source.
