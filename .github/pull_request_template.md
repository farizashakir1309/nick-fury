This will be my approach for the whole app making process.I will be using goorme ide for this job with nom framework.I will be making simple pages with no backend work and no database involvement.Although this project frontend can be easily used for a projects which will require backend job.I will be using simple HTML ,CSS,JAVASCRIPT,JQuery,BOOTSTRAP and other liabraries if necessary.
